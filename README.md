Restaurant Sales Analysis ‚Äì (Q1 2023)

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data to help managers uncover meaningful insights from customer orders, item performance, 
and category trends. Using Power BI, SQL, and Excel I transformed transactional data from a 3-month period into a powerful decision-support tool.

Objective

To analyze order and sales performance from January to March 2023
To identify top and low-performing items and categories
To discover monthly ordering trends and customer preferences
To present insights through a clear, interactive Power BI dashboard
To recommend actionable strategies that could increase profitability and efficiency

Dataset Description
The dataset includes:

Order IDs & details: Transactional data capturing order frequency
Item metadata: Item names, categories, and prices
Spend values: Total spend per item and category
Time dimension: Date of order to analyze trends over time

üõ†Ô∏èTools Used

SQL - For in-depth analysis
Power BI ‚Äì Dashboard design and visualization
DAX ‚Äì For calculated measures and KPIs
Data Transformation ‚Äì Power Query for data cleaning and shaping


Insights & Findings

Best-Performing Items:

Korean Beef Bowl generated the highest revenue: $11K
Hamburger had the highest number of orders: 622 orders
These items form the restaurant‚Äôs core value drivers

Underperformers:

Chicken Tacos had the lowest number of orders (123) and total revenue (~$1K)
This makes it a candidate for reevaluation or removal

Category Insights:

Asian cuisine is the most profitable category
American cuisine has high order volume but low overall spend

üìÖ Monthly Trends

Order volume remains consistent month over month,
Suggests a stable customer base with potential to grow via marketing

Recommendations

Promote Top Performers
- Bundle or upsell items like Korean Beef Bowl and Cheeseburger
- Improve or Phase Out Low Performers
- Investigate why Chicken Tacos underperformed (taste, price, visibility?)
- Capitalize on Asian Category Growth
- Introduce new dishes, limited-time offers, or combos in this category
- Seasonal Promotions to Create Peaks
- Currently, flat monthly trends could benefit from special events
- Analyze Price Elasticity
- Some items have high revenue but low order counts ‚Äì consider minor price adjustments

Business Impact

- This dashboard empowers restaurant owners and managers to:
- Understand customer preferences
- Make data-backed menu decisions
- Optimize pricing strategies
- Design targeted promotions
- Reduce waste by identifying underperformers



Next Steps
- I plan to continue refining this project by:
- Adding dynamic filters by customer or region
- Integrating customer feedback/satisfaction scores
- Building a forecasting module based on time-series modeling

Thanks for joining me on this project. See you in the next one
